##7 Summer holidays for Evol Online!

##0 Once more, a lot of work has been done, recently on the consistency
##0 and quality of the game. A lot of new graphics will be part of the
##0 next release, Beta2. Interactivity between the player and the game
##0 was our main goal the past weeks.

##0 This new dynamic and gaming experience will be revealed throughout
##0 animations full of mysteries. Treasure chests, coconuts and new NPCs
##0 have appeared on a brand new map!

##0 The work on the translations, the repositorie reorganizations and
##0 on top of all, the client, were one of our main concerns lately.
##0 The developers still need a bit of time in order to finish this
##0 release, thus we thank you for waiting.

##9 -- Regards, Alige.

##7 A contantly evolving Beta!

##0 Good news, most of the needed work for the Beta2 has been finished.
##0 However, there are still some language tasks left, and we need
##0 your help for this!

##0 The game rules were added on the Beta2, the no-law world reached to
##0 its end! You can review a copy of these rules on our site.

##0 A development pause will be made between the Beta session and the
##0 Aurora release. This break will be done in order to rethink most of
##0 our future guidelines.

##0 We will notify you of the release date in the next news. It should
##0 technically be one week before the release itself.

##9 -- Cheers, Reid.

##7 Guidelines for future releases have been established!

##0 As you may know, ##BEvol Online##b has seen multiple development
##0 stages during the past years. It is now the time to look forward and
##0 to establish the bases of our future development roadmaps.

##0 At the end of the third and last Beta release, we will switch
##0 to a new style of development. It will be formed of two types
##0 of releases.

##0 The first, called ##BAurora##b, will continue the selected story and
##0 will be the main quest line. ##BSkylandia##b will be the second type.
##0 It will be composed of some side-quests from the Aurora releases, as
##0 well as revealing some secrets of the ##BAemil##b world.

##0 A last development release has been prepared, the ##BMercurian##b
##0 one. This type is currently hidden and nothing will be spoiled as it
##0 will end the game story.
##0 So be patient!

##9 -- Cheers, Reid.

##7 Land Ahoy!

##0 Almost two months have passed since we began redesigning our
##0 content and concept base. One of the changes was made for the 
##0 mascot, the Pious, which will now be renamed to Piou.

##0 We still need few weeks before being done with the graphic part.
##0 But we started to concept the Level Design (including new quests,
##0 dialogues, maps). Most of this should be done in May, so be
##0 ready to the next episode for this month!

##0 Here are some important links, if you wish to take part in the
##0 development or if you just wish to talk with us.

##7 Evol Online Beta releases!
