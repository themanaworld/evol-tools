##7 What a scary... I mean... weird development team!
 
##0 Hey, why did the ship stop?! Was that under Nard's orders? Lets
##0 find out! Oh no, giant pumpkins overran all of the boat! It seems
##0 you must get ready for battle. You can sense something very
##0 powerful and evil at the far bottom of the ship. You should check
##0 it out. Maybe Bachus, the party spirit, could help you throughout
##0 this. We hope you'll enjoy this Halloween event.
 
##0 Once again, Evol Online developers are in a rush. Beta2 takes a
##0 whole lot longer than they thought but this is of course to avoid
##0 any kind of issue. Again, a numerous amount of bugs were fixed and
##0 scripts were mostly all rewritten for a better game experience.
 
##0 As a lot of dialogues were added and improved for Beta2,
##0 translations are needed more than ever. Even though some developers
##0 also work on these, they cannot afford working on all of them.
 
##0 If you feel like you can help developers in any way, especially for
##0 translations if you speak english fluently, feel free to contact
##0 them using Evol Online's IRC developer channel.
 
##9 -- Regards, Alige.

##7 End of summer, beginning of Beta2!
 
##0 Summer holidays are now over for the Evol Online developers. We are
##0 proud to announce the arrival of Beta2 soon, even though we
##0 unfortunately find ourselves currently behind schedule.
 
##0 However, a lot of efforts were made to create a lot of new content
##0 and great new tilesets which took for ever to create and fix.
##0 We are currently fixing bugs and preparing the release. Final
##0 modifications are being made to give you the best release ever made
##0 for this project.
 
##0 Among the new features is a Quest Window that has been added to the
##0 client. It will help you see your progress in game.
 
##0 When the Beta2 release will be out, we would like you to promote it
##0 by simply spreading the word around you. Players will then be aware
##0 of the news and this may help us expand our community.
 
##0 As you already now, new contributors are always welcome!
##0 Translators, artists and even writers are free to contact us for
##0  more information.
  
##9 -- Regards, Alige.
##9 August 2012
 
 
##0 Once more, a lot of work has been done, recently on the consistency
##0 and quality of the game. A lot of new graphics will be part of the
##0 next release, Beta2. Interactivity between the player and the game
##0 was our main goal the past weeks.
 
##0 This new dynamic and gaming experience will be revealed throughout
##0 animations full of mysteries. Treasure chests, coconuts and new
##0 have appeared on a brand new map!
 
##0 The work on the translations, the repository reorganizations and
##0 on top of all, the client, were one of our main concerns lately.
##0 The developers still need a bit of time in order to finish this
##0 release, thus we thank you for waiting.
 
##9 -- Regards, Alige.

##7 A contantly evolving Beta!
 
##0 Good news, most of the needed work for the Beta2 has been finished.
##0 However, there are still some language tasks left, and we need
##0 your help for this!
 
##0 The game rules were added on the Beta2, the no-law world reached to
##0 its end! You can review a copy of these rules on our site.
 
##0 A development pause will be made between the Beta session and the
##0 Aurora release. This break will be done in order to rethink most of
##0 our future guidelines.
 
##0 We will notify you of the release date in the next news. It should
##0 technically be one week before the release itself.
 
##9 -- Cheers, Reid.

##7 Guidelines for future releases have been established!
 
##0 As you may know, ##BEvol Online##b has seen multiple development
##0 stages during the past years. It is now the time to look forward
##0 and to establish the bases of our future development roadmaps.
 
##0 At the end of the third and last Beta release, we will switch
##0 to a new style of development. It will be formed of two types
##0 of releases.
 
##0 The first, called ##BAurora##b, will continue the selected story
##0 and will be the main quest line. ##BSkylandia##b will be the second
##0 type. It will be composed of some side-quests from the Aurora
##0 releases, as well as revealing the secrets of ##BAemil##b.
 
##0 A last development release has been prepared, the ##BMercurian##b
##0 one. This type is currently hidden and nothing will be spoiled as
##0 it will end the game story.
##0 So be patient!
 
##9 -- Cheers, Reid.

##7 Land Ahoy!
 
##0 Almost two months have passed since we began redesigning our
##0 content and concept base. One of the changes was made for the 
##0 mascot, the Pious, which will now be renamed to 'Piou'.
 
##0 We still need few weeks before being done with the graphic part.
##0 But we started to concept the Level Design (including new quests,
##0 dialogues, maps). Most of this should be done in May, so be
##0 ready to the next episode for this month!
 
##0 Here are some important links, if you wish to take part in the
##0 development or if you just wish to talk with us.

##0 dream we have in common.
