##7 Evolving Beta

##0 Good news, most of the work needed for the Beta #2 has been
##0 done! However, there are still some language tasks left, and
##0 we would need your help for this!

##0 The Game Rules were added on this new Beta. The no-law world has
##0 ended! You can review a copy of these rules on our site.

##0 A Development interlude will be made between the Beta session
##0 and the Aurora release. This payse will be made to organise most
##0 of our future guidelines.

##0 We will notify you for the release date on the next news. It
##0 should normally be one week before the Beta #2 release itself.

##7 Guidelines for the next releases

##0 As you may know, ##BEvol Online##b has seen multiple development
##0 stages during the last years. It is now time to look forward and
##0 to program what will be our future development roadmaps.

##0 At the end of the third and last Beta release, we will switch to
##0 a new style of development. It will be composed of two different
##0 paths.

##0 The first, called ##BAurora##b, will continue the selected story
##0 and will be the main story. ##BSkylandia##b will be the second
##0 one and will build some side-quests from the Aurora Releases, as
##0 well as showing some secrets from the ##BAemil##b world.

##0 A last development release has been prepared, the ##BMercurian##b-
##0 releases. This one is currently hidden and nothing of it will be
##0 spoiled as it will end the game story.
##0 So be patient!

##7 Land Ahoy!

##0 Almost two months have passed since we began redesigning our
##0 content and concept bases. One of the changes was made to the 
##0 mascot, the Pious, which will now be called Piou.

##0 We still need few weeks of work before being done with the
##0 graphical part. However, we started to work on the Leve Design
##0 concept, including new quests, dialogues, maps, etc... Most of
##0 this should be done in May, so be ready for the next episode
##0 this month!

##0 Here are some important links if you wish to take part in the
##0 development or if you just wish to talk with us.

##7 Evol Online Beta Release #1

##0 After several months of work, the world of ##BEvol Online##b
##0 finally opens its doors to everyone for its Beta #1!

##0 This Beta release will be the first among two other ones which
##0 will  help  the  developers  finding  out  the  qualities and
##0 problems of the chosen gameplay.

##0 We welcome you to give us your thoughts about this, but we also
##0 hope you will have fun being part of this amazing adventure.

##0 We also need to warn you that at the end of the third release,
##0 Beta #3, all characters will be wiped as we are trying to have a
##0 perfect balance for this game and start it over with it.
##0 We kindly ask you to accept this.

##0 On this Christmas morning, the Evol Online team is here to wish
##0 you all a Merry Christmas and to inform you that the beta
##0 release of ##BEvol Online##b will be soon available!

##0 No, this is not a joke! After more than a year of work and
##0 through good and bad times, the team finally decided to release
##0 the Beta #1.

##0 Over one year has passed during which we have been working on
##0 the in-game design and in the new arrangement of our server and
##0 client. The time came to show it publicly!

##0 We, ##BEvol Online##b developers, hope to get as many beta
##0 testers as we can in order to get as many point of views as
##0 possible.

##0 We thank you for your patience and also for sharing this dream
##0 with us.
